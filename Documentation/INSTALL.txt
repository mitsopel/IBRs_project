— Crawler Service
The service can use either the Firefox WebDriver or the PhantomJS WebDriver.
The Firefox WebDriver is useful for previewing and is generally more robust.

!!!
Switching between the WebDrivers also requires excluding the NOT used
dependency from pom.xml because they support different version of Selenium and this creates problems.
